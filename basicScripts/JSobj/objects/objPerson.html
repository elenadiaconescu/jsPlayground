<!--Object Properties-->
<!--The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties-->

<!--Object Methods-->
<!--Objects can also have methods.-->
<!--Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.-->
<!--Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.-->

<!--The this Keyword-->

<!--In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.-->
<!--In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.-->
<!--In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.-->
<!--Read more about the this keyword at JS this Keyword.-->
<!--https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp-->

<!--Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!-->
<!--When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object-->
