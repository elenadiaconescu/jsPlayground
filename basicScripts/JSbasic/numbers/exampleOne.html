<h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

<p>Numbers can be written with or without decimals:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
    var x = 3.14;
    var y = 3;
    var z = 123e5;    // 12300000
    var t = 123e-5;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + "<br>" + y + z + "<br>" + t;
</script>

<!--JavaScript Numbers are Always 64-bit Floating Point-->
<!--Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc.-->
<!--JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard.-->
<!--This format stores numbers in 64 bits, where the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51, the exponent in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63-->
