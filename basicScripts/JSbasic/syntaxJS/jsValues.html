JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.

Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.

JavaScript Literals
The most important rules for writing fixed values are:
Numbers are written with or without decimals:
Strings are text, written within double or single quotes

JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare variables.
An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6

JavaScript Operators
JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values
JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables

JavaScript Expressions
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
The computation is called an evaluation.
For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50

JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
The var keyword tells the browser to create variables

JavaScript Comments
Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
Comments are ignored, and will not be executed

JavaScript Identifiers
Identifiers are names.
In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels).
The rules for legal names are much the same in most programming languages.
In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.

All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.
The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:

JavaScript and Camel Case
Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:
Hyphens:
first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.
Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
Underscore:
first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.
Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):
FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.
Lower Camel Case:
JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
JavaScript Character Set
JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
