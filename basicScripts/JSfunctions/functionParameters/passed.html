Arguments are Passed by Value
The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments.
JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations.
If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value.
Changes to arguments are not visible (reflected) outside the function.


Objects are Passed by Reference
In JavaScript, object references are values.
Because of this, objects will behave like they are passed by reference:
If a function changes an object property, it changes the original value.
Changes to object properties are visible (reflected) outside the function.
